I plan to make this into a unit test at some point, but for now it's pasted here so we can access it

Is this what we have?
JSquared — 28/05/2024 13:15
Not sure, I haven't run our code
Furthermore, this is the reduction matrix for v = [1,1,1]

^^ the data is formatted as four matrices, the first one is the constant term and I believe the next three correspond to the u_3, u_2, and u_1 terms (because of revlex order)

Let's test out the first few steps of reduction using the z^3 term
This has a term that's [4 1 4] in Edgar's notation
which means x^27y^6z^27
That one has the following vector at the start:
[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2]
And here is the first chunk of reduction:
After Step 1: [0 326 0 0 0 0 19 0 53 0 16 0 0 0 0]
After Step 2: [0 0 0 0 0 219 0 167 0 340 0 0 0 0 0]
After Step 3: [0 308 0 0 0 0 226 0 144 0 163 0 0 0 0]
After Step 4: [0 0 0 0 0 339 0 80 0 262 0 0 0 0 0]
After Step 5: [0 330 0 0 0 0 121 0 79 0 178 0 0 0 0]
After Step 6: [0 0 0 0 0 232 0 161 0 34 0 0 0 0 0]
After Step 7: [0 308 0 0 0 0 175 0 147 0 289 0 0 0 0]
So the first three are guarenteed to be using the R_u,[1,1,1] based on the algorithm
